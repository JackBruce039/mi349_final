                Hattrick the Magician is an ongoing project in my current Game Minor class; MI497. It is a 3D VR game where you play as a stage magician
                performing various magic tricks for an audience. Hattrick started as the last prototyping project in the previous class (MI455),
                where we worked to develop a playble vertical sliver in slightly less than three weeks. It then was chosen as one of five games chosen to 
                move on to MI497, and was one of two initally slotted to move on from the beginning. It is the only VR game of the games in our year. We have 
                now worked over the summer of 2021 and this current fall semester to polish it into a full playable game.

                My role on this project was primarily as a Game Desiner, however for this project especially I contributed to a fair bit of Programming and Art.
                Hattrick doesn't have any levels, due to it being one "level" with multiple tricks to perform. The tricks were some of the main sources of design
                on the project. I was soely responsible for five of twelve tricks we designed, and contributed to the thought processes behind many of the tweaks and
                changes made to the other tricks. Unfortunately due to time, my specific tricks had to be cut in varrying stages of completion. Outside of the tricks,
                I designed almost all of the User Experience of Hattrick including the overall game loop, title screen functionality, and cut content like our Backstage.

                In addition to Design, I helped out on both the programming and art side of production. I implemented optimization practices such as occlusion culling and
                anti-alliasing to help limit the impact the effect of our gameobjects, art, and lighting on our game. I also programmed features like our step-by-step
                checklist for each trick and haptic feedback. On the Art side, I was responsible for nearly all of the visual effects for Hattrick, however due to cut tricks
                a fair bit of them were scrapped as well.
