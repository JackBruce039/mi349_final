                Chain Gang was a group project from the first class in MSU's Game Minor; MI445.
                This was the first group project of the class and the first attempt at making fleshed out game.
                My primary role at the time was as level and overall game designer. I designed our tutorial level and levels 1 - 4. 
                My main goal for the level design was to harken back to the flash platformer games I had played as a kid and try to recreate
                that nostalgia while creating fun concepts that would highlight our main mechanic, controlling two characters who are linked together.
                I would start with the chain-linked character as a base and then think of interesting ways I could have them traverse the levels
                other than walking; having them swing accross chasms or carry the other character using the chain. Once I had a "gimmick"
                for the level, I would use the environment to play with that gimmick in different ways. I would sketch the prototype level on paper and then
                play through it using my finger or some other small object to see if I felt it was fun or would fit the game. I also was responsible for 
                various programming and art feats in the game. These mostly consisted of small scripts and sprites used for puzzle or UI functionality. 
                Some examples included our tutorial text system and lever sprite.

                Chain Gang was an incredibly sucessful first attempt for both my team and I. It was awarded Best Game of the nine other games in the running for 
                that round of game projects in addition to Most Fun and Most Playable by our class, our professors, and a seperate panel of judges from 
                outside our class.
